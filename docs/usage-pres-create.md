A "Presentation" is a single `.pptx` file.

(See [Saving Multiple Presentations](/PptxGenJS/docs/usage-saving#saving-multiple-presentations) for information
on creating more than a one PPTX file at-a-time).

## Modern Node-Based Applications

```typescript
import pptxgen from "pptxgenjs";
let pres = new pptxgen();
```

## Client Web Browser

```javascript
let pres = new PptxGenJS();
```
